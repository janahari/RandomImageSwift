**Interactor**: Contains business logic like fetching image data from url and attaching to presenter 
**Presenter**: Mediates between the View and Interactor . Loading data from interactor protocol and we Will use in View.
**Entity** : Represents the data model class . We created model class using Struct and Decodable protocol.
